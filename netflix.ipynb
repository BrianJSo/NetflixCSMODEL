    "The dataset 'Netflix Movies and TV Shows' was collected from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine. Flixable was created in 2018 by Ville Salminen, and it came with additional advanced search functionality which was missing from the implemented search engine of Netflix. The data was extracted from the Flixable database through the use of API calls.\n",

Despite the popularity of the aforementioned site, we cannot confirm whether the dataset that was extracted from Flixable is reliable. Moreover, considering that the latest update for the dataset was on November 2019, the conclusions made in this case study may not be representative of the current Netflix shows as of September, 2020."
